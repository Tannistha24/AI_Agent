# AI Agent System
Overview

→ Python-based AI Agent implemented using a Jupyter Notebook
→ Designed to autonomously process inputs, make decisions, and generate responses
→ Focuses on logical flow, task handling, and agent-based interaction

Technology Stack

→ Python
→ Jupyter Notebook
→ AI / ML Libraries (as used in the notebook)
→ Supporting libraries for data processing and automation

Scope of Work

→ Agent logic and workflow design
→ Input processing and response generation
→ Task execution based on defined rules or models
→ Structured and reproducible implementation

Execution Instructions

→ Install required Python dependencies
→ Open the AI Agent notebook in Jupyter Notebook
→ Execute cells sequentially to initialize and run the agent

Intended Use

→ Academic and learning purposes
→ AI agent concept demonstration
→ Foundation for advanced autonomous or intelligent systems

Disclaimer

→ This project is developed for educational and experimental use
→ Not intended for production or critical decision-making systems
